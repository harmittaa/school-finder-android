# school-finder-android
The school finder app created for Big & Open Data Hackathon 2017 in Windhoek, NA.

The school finder app was designed because there is currently not a centralized location where the Namibians could browse both public
and private schools all over the country. Currently the school finder enables users to browse and filter schools listed on the school finder database. The schools can be viewed on a map (currently only on Google Maps) or browsed through on a list.

The filters include:
- Keyword search
- Location (city/town)
- Public and / or private schools
- Available positions for learners

The data for the schools is pulled from a Firebase database, which was manually populated, thus the current data might not be completely accurate. The data for available positions was randomized.

A web control panel is under development, but it is currently not finalized. In the control panel the schools would be able to edit their information, for example available positions for learners and curriculum.

Future development for the application would include:
- Token based access for the database
- Web control panel
- UI polishing
- Gathering complete and accurate data of schools
- More filtering options
- UI fixes for devices with very small screens
