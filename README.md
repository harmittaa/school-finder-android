# school-finder-android
The school finder app created for Big & Open Data Hackathon 2017 in Windhoek, NA.

The given challenge was that there is no up to date listing of public nor private schools in Namibia, the app was created to make all 
the public and private schools accessible from one place.

The app pulls it's data from Firebase database, which has the following information about schools:
- Name
- Address
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Phone number
- Offered grades

A web interface was also developed to allow schools to update their data into the database, future development perhaps allowing the schools
 to add real time information whether there are any open positions for learners.
